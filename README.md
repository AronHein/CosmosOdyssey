# Cosmos Odyssey

The web application is deployed on Render and available [here](https://cosmosodyssey-4zyi.onrender.com). Since the application needs to cold start, it may take a minute or two to load.

## Setup to run the project locally
In order to run the project locally, you need to add MongoDb connection string and database name in `appsettings.json` file that is located in WebApp project folder.
To get the connection string and database name, you need to create a database. A short guide on how to create a database is available [here](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/platform/mongodb-atlas-tutorial#create-a-mongodb-cloud-account).
After inserting the connection string and database name, you can run the WebApp project.
